# Labyrinth
A labyrinth game where you can only see the walls illuminated by your torch. 


For anywhom who is interested in a quick demo of my skills. Please keep in mind, that i'm only a university student, without any work experience.
You can take a glance at my code right here (only uploading the important ones), or can see the whole thing if you download the zip file and run the exe file in the bin folder.
(The premade zip contains additional files that you will need)

You can play with 3 different tables. On every map you will start in the left-bottom corner, and your aim is to reach the right-upper corner.
You can see the elapsed time on a status bar, and pause the game. You can step with the arrows. 

Unfortunately this game is only Hungarian at the moment,but you can understand it easily, so feel free to play a round :)
